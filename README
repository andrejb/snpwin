This program estimates neighborhoods for SNPs given the zygotical information
of a sample of individuals. It consists on 4 steps, from processing data to
generating images to visualize data:

  1. Neighborhood estimation.
  2. Windows calculation.
  3. Chi-square statistics calculation.
  4. Figures generation.

Each of these parts lie on its own folder. Inside each folder you can type
`make` and `make run` to, respectivelly, compile and run each step.

Please check the file named LICENSE in this folder for information on copying

What follows is a description of input and output of each part of the program.

==============================================================================

1. Neighborhood estimation
--------------------------

Consumes:

  - Data file with SNP zygotical information. The file should have one SNP per
    line with individuals' zigotical values in columns. Each line should
    respect the following format:

        C POS NAME VAL1 VAL2 ... VALN

    Where:
    
      - C is the chromosome where the SNP is located.
      - POS is the SNP distance with respect to the beginning of the
        chromosome.
      - NAME is the chromosome name.
      - VAL1 ... VALN is the preprocessed zygotical information for each
        individual of the sample.

    Note that SNPs should be ordered regarding the chromosome they lie on and
    their position inside that chromosome in order to neighborhood calculation
    make sense.

    In our case, the data file lies in `/var/tmp/data-ordered.txt`, but you
    can change this in the file `1.neighborhoods/Makefile`.

Produces:

  - results/neighborhoods.txt:
    
    Each line of this file contains the results of
    left and right neighborhood for one SNP, as well as the ratio between the
    likelihood of the chosen neighborhood and the likelihood of having no
    neighborhood at all.


2. Windows calculation
----------------------

Consumes:

  - results/neighborhoods.txt

Produces:

  - results/windows-windows.txt:

    This file contains the left and right limits of each calculated window,
    one per line.


3. Chi-square statistics calculation
------------------------------------

Consumes:

  - results/windows-windows.txt
  - results/neighborhoods.txt
  - /var/tmp/data-ordered.txt
  - data/affection.txt - file with one line per individual containing `1` if
    the individual is affected by the disease (case) or `0` in case the
    individual is not affected by the disease (control).

Produces:

  - results/chi-square-chi-square.txt

    This file contains the chi-square statistics for each window regarding its
    correlation with affectinonness of individuals.


4. Figures generation
---------------------

Consumes:

  - results/chi-square-chi-square.txt

Produces

  - 4.figures/img/snps-pvalue.ps
  - 4.figures/img/snps-pvalue.png
  
  These figures will plot the results of chi-square calculation for each
  window found in the previous steps.
